# WolframAlphaBot
A simple Telegram bot to ask queries to WolframAlpha API in Python

## How-to

1 - In the file credentials.json fill the parameters TOKEN and Client with your
Telegram token and WolframAlpha Client ID respectively

2 - Before running, go in your terminal and do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
This will install all the necessary modules for WolframAlphaBot to run

## Compatibility

This bot was tested with Python 3.6+ and PyPy3, PyPy3 will NOT work on Windows systems, because Windows
is really a bad operating system, sorry, Microsoft (And you can't even install it on WSL, losers!).
The bot will have optimal performance with PyPy3.
